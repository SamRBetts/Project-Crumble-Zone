    This README is a message... and part of a system of messages ...pay attention to it!

    Writing this README was important to me. I considered myself to be a powerful designer.

    This folder is not a place of honor ... no highly esteemed assembly is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.

    What is here was broken and repulsive to me. This message is a warning about jank.

    The danger is in a particular assembly... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular file, and below this README.

    The jank is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.

    The jank is to the mind, and it can kill.

    The form of the jank is an emanation of poor time management.

    The jank is unleashed only if you substantially modify these assemblies physically. This folder is best shunned and left read-only.
